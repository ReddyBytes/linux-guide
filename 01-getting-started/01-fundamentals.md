## What is Hardware?

The **physical components** of a computer—such as the **CPU (Central Processing Unit), memory (RAM), motherboard, storage devices, and network interface cards**—are collectively known as **hardware**.

End users typically interact with applications like **web browsers (e.g., Chrome), media platforms (e.g., YouTube), or productivity tools (e.g., Excel)**. These applications, in turn, need to interact with hardware to perform tasks such as file creation, computations, or data transmission.

However, neither users nor applications directly manage how much CPU, memory, or other resources are allocated. This responsibility lies with the **Operating System (OS)**—a vital **intermediary layer** that bridges between software (applications and user commands) and hardware.

### Key Functions of the Operating System

An OS performs several core tasks to manage system functionality efficiently:

1. **Device Management** – Controls and coordinates hardware devices such as keyboards, disk drives, printers, and display monitors.
2. **Network Management** – Handles connectivity and communication over local and wide-area networks.
3. **Resource Management** – Allocates CPU time, memory, and storage to different tasks and applications.
4. **Process Management** – Manages running processes, including task scheduling and execution.


### Types of Operating Systems

Some of the most widely used operating systems today include:
1. **Linux**
2. **Windows**
3. **macOS**

### A Brief History of Operating Systems

- **1960s** – The first modern operating system, **UNIX**, was developed. It was one of the earliest OS to be written in C and gained popularity for its modularity and power. It was also **open-source**, promoting collaborative development.

- **1970s** – **MINIX** was created as a simplified version of UNIX, mainly for educational purposes. However, it was **not open-source**.

- **1980s** – **Microsoft introduced Windows**, which provided a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, allowing users to operate a computer without relying on command-line knowledge. Windows required a **commercial license**.

- **1991** – **Linus Torvalds** developed the **Linux kernel**, inspired by UNIX and MINIX. Unlike MINIX, Linux was **fully open-source**, which enabled global collaboration and rapid development.


Linux has become the **backbone of modern computing**, especially in enterprise environments, data centers, and cloud infrastructure. Some key reasons for its popularity:  

**1. Cost-Effectiveness**    

- **Free and Open Source**: Linux does not require expensive licensing fees, making it a cost-effective choice for companies.  
- **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Linux is stable and requires minimal maintenance, reducing operational expenses.

#### 2. Performance and Efficiency
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Linux is lightweight and consumes fewer system resources compared to Windows.
- **High Scalability**: Linux efficiently scales from small embedded systems to enterprise data centers without performance degradation.

#### 3. Security and Reliability
- **Less Vulnerable to Malware**: Linux has strong user privilege separation, making it more secure against viruses and malware.
- **Frequent and Transparent Updates**: Regular security patches ensure system stability without requiring frequent reboots.
- **High Stability**: Linux systems can run for years without crashes, ensuring better uptime and reliability.
